LCSFoundationKit
================

## Synopsis

This is a collection of categories on classes defined by Foundation.framework. The category methods are mostly simple helper functions. The code runs on OS X 10.9 and iOS 7. Check the header files for the documentation. 

This is of course work in progress.

## Examples

Examples of defined methods are: `-[NSArray anyObject]`, which returns a random member of an array or `-[NSString completeRange]`, which returns an NSRange for the whole string in the receiver.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## Tests
